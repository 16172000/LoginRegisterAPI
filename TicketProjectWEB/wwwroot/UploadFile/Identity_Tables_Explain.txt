When you create an ASP.NET MVC project and use the ASP.NET Identity framework (or ASP.NET Core Identity in ASP.NET Core applications), a set of predefined tables is automatically generated in your database to handle user authentication and authorization. These tables are used to store user-related data and are an integral part of the Identity framework. Below are the commonly generated tables when you create an Identity-based ASP.NET MVC application:

AspNetUsers: This table stores user account information, including fields such as Id (user's unique identifier), UserName, Email, PasswordHash, PhoneNumber, and other user-related properties. It's the primary table for storing user profiles.

AspNetRoles: This table is used to store roles that users can belong to. Each role has a Id (unique identifier) and Name (the role name). Roles are used for role-based authorization.

AspNetUserRoles: This table is used to establish a many-to-many relationship between users and roles. It stores the mapping of which users belong to which roles.

AspNetUserLogins: This table is used to store external login provider information (e.g., log in with Google or Facebook). It stores data such as LoginProvider, ProviderKey, and UserId to link external logins to user accounts.

AspNetUserClaims: This table is used to store user-specific claims or additional user-related data. Claims are typically used to store information like user roles, custom properties, or other user-specific data.

AspNetUserTokens: This table stores tokens associated with users. These tokens are often used for security-related operations like password reset or two-factor authentication.

AspNetRoleClaims: This table is used to store claims associated with roles. Claims can be attached to roles to grant additional permissions or attributes to users in that role.

AspNetUserLoginProviders: This table stores information about external login providers configured for the application. It includes fields like LoginProvider and ProviderKey.

These predefined tables help manage user authentication, authorization, and related data efficiently. They simplify the implementation of user management and security features in your ASP.NET MVC application.

It's important to note that the exact table names and schema may vary slightly depending on the version of ASP.NET Identity you are using (ASP.NET Identity for ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Core Identity for ASP.NET Core). Additionally, you can customize these tables and their schema to some extent if needed, but the default schema provides a solid foundation for most applications.
